# Getting started with CWL

This training will walk you through the development of a
best-practices CWL workflow.  At the conclusion of this training, you
should have a grasp of the essential components of a workflow, and
have a basis for learning more.

These lessons are based on [Introduction to RNA-seq using
high-performance computing
(HPC)](https://github.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2) lessons
developed by members of the teaching team at the Harvard Chan
Bioinformatics Core (HBC).  The original training, which includes
additional lectures about the biology of RNA-seq, can be found at that
link.
