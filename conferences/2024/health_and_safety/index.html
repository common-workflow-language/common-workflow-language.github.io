<h2>Health and Safety</h2>

<p>The event has a Health and Safety policy (inspired by <a href="https://publichealthpledge.com">publichealthpledge.com</a>).

<p>If the policy changes it is only strengthened - never weakened - between the event's announcement and the event itself.</p>

<p>The event actively communicates this policy by including it on their website, in the registration flow, and speaker proposal process, discussing the policy regularly during events, and including it everywhere important announcements are shared.</p>
<p>The event's policy includes active measures designed to minimize the number of participants who are infected with transmissible diseases like COVID-19, as well as mitigate transmission between participants.</p>
