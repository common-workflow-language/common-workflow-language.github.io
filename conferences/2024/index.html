    <h2>CWLCon 2024</h2>
    <p>
        We are hosting a CWL Conference in Europe in May 2024!
        The conference will be hosted via the matrix app. This means presenters and participants may choose to attend in-person event or engage remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submissions will open in February 2024
    </p>

    <h2>Call for Submissions</h2>

    <p>JOIN US FOR THE 4th ANNUAL CWL CONFERENCE & 10th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION</p>

    <p>Founded in 2014, the Common Workflow Language (CWL) project originated from the conversations at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference CodeFest.
    CWL is a well-known and advocated standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows.
        The CWL annual conference was first held online in 2021. It has since been held online and hybrid mode in the past two years.</p>

    <p>Building on the experience from the past, the CWL 2024 conference will be officially hosted as a hybrid event in the historical city of Amsterdam.
    The conference will feature contributed talks from speakers, vendors, training sessions and a hackathon / collaboration-fest.
        There will also be many networking opportunities at the conference.</p>

    <p>The conference organising committee will like to invite abstracts from any discipline.
    The target audiences for this conference are broad and include existing or potential CWL users, research software engineers and workflow engine developers.
        We envisage to provide immersive learning opportunities and stimulating environment for individuals from varying background and interests.</p>

    <p>Moreover, our conference is dedicated to fostering inclusiveness, urging active involvement, and welcoming contributions from individuals with diverse backgrounds.
    Collectively, we aim to create a collaborative and supportive environment that fosters the development of ideas and solutions.</p>

    <p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the organisers directly.</p>
