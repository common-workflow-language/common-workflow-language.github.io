                <p>JOIN US FOR THE 4th ANNUAL CWL CONFERENCE & 10th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION</p>

                <p>The Common Workflow Language (CWL) project originated from the conversations at the 2014 Bioinformatics Open Source Conference CodeFest.
                    CWL is a well-known and advocated standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows.
                    The CWL annual conference was first held online in 2021. It has since been held online and hybrid mode in the past two years.</p>

                <p>Building on the experience from the past, the CWL 2024 conference will be hosted as a hybrid event in the Netherlands and online.
                    The conference will feature contributed talks from speakers, vendor presentations, training sessions, and a hackathon / collaboration-fest.
                    There will also be many networking opportunities at the conference.</p>

                <p>The conference organising committee will invite abstracts from any discipline.
                    The target audiences for this conference include existing or potential CWL users, research software engineers, and workflow engine developers.
                    We aim to provide immersive learning opportunities and stimulating environment for individuals from varying background and interests.</p>

                <p>Moreover, our conference is dedicated to fostering inclusiveness, urging active involvement, and welcoming contributions from individuals with diverse backgrounds.
                    Collectively, we aim to create a collaborative and supportive environment that fosters the development of ideas and solutions.</p>

                <p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the organisers directly.</p>

                <p>The event has a Health and Safety policy (inspired by <a href="https://publichealthpledge.com">publichealthpledge.com</a>).</p>

                <p>The policy comprises the following components:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In-person participants will be required to wear a FFP3 face mask.</li>
                    <li>Any scheduled meals and coffee breaks will be outside.</li>
                    <li>Attendees will be expected to perform a rapid COVID-19 test prior to participating each day.</li>
                    <li>The CO2 level in the rooms will be monitored to ensure good ventilation (PPM under 1000).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>If the policy changes it is only strengthened - never weakened - between the event's announcement and the event itself.</i></p>
