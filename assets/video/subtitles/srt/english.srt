00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
In many scientific fields such as
bioinformatics, medical imaging, and

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,299
astronomy
large quantities of data need to be

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,769
analyzed. This can involve large-scale
and repetitive processes in long

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,240
pipelines of different tools â€” referred to
as workflows. It can be very

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,930
time-consuming to run data for all these
different tools by hand and convert

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,949
outputs to various formats to make them
compatible with the next step.

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,130
Workflow management systems are designed
to alleviate this problem by allowing

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,090
these workflows to be expressed formally
and providing infrastructure to set up.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,290
execute, and monitor them. This formal
expression of workflows allows for

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,399
scientists to easily share and reuse
them. Crucially they can also be used to

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,110
verify results of computation for
published work. However there are many

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,579
competing [ways] for describing
workflows which is a barrier to this aim.

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,399
Currently there are over a hundred
different data analysis workflow systems

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,020
with no interoperability between them.
The need has arisen to have a single

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,469
common standard and so the "Common
Workflow Language" project was created: an

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,430
open standard designed to express
workflows and their tooling in groups of

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,539
YAML structured text files.
