00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
in many scientific fields such as

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,629
bioinformatics medical imaging and

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,380
astronomy

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,299
large quantities of data need to be

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,790
analyzed this can involve large-scale

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,769
and repetitive processes in long

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,630
pipelines of different tools referred to

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,240
as workflows it can be very

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,949
time-consuming to run data for all these

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,930
different tools by hand and convert

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,609
outputs to various formats to make them

12
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,949
compatible with the next step

13
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,090
workflow management systems are designed

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,130
to alleviate this problem by allowing

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
these workflows to be expressed formally

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,090
and providing infrastructure to set up

17
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,700
execute and monitor them this formal

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,290
expression of workflows allows for

19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,760
scientists to easily share and reuse

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
them crucially they can also be used to

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
verify results of computation for

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,110
published work however there are many

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,730
competing standards for describing

24
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,579
workflows which is a barrier to the same

25
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,180
currently there are over a hundred

26
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,399
different data analysis workflow systems

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,649
with no interoperability between them

28
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,020
the need has arisen to have a single

29
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,730
common standard and so the common

30
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,469
workflow language project was created an

31
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,629
open standard design to express

32
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,430
workflows in their tooling in groups of
